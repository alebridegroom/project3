Welcome to our Project 3 Website! 
We chose to focus on the 2016 election year, as that year was significant in U.S. history. We focused specifically on Swing States, candidate votes by State, and voter demographics. If you click below, you will be redirected to one of the three options for our project. 
Based on the information we analyzed, you can see which candidate was the most voted for by Swing State, which candidates had the most votes in each State, and the most common voter demographics per candidate.
